1. Remake plot of figure 1D in paper by Parekh et. al.

2. "up-tf-stem.counts.tsv" is the data file used for plotting

3. Please check "remake_plot_tSNE.R" for plotting. However, final figure appears to be different compare to that in the paper.

4. There is another plotting R code ("remake_plot_with_demo_code.R") using instructor provided file "up-tf-stem_clustering.Robj" and demo code. This one generates the same plot demonstrated in the paper.
