### Example code
This is some exmaple text to show how you can annotate your code and provide information about what you're doing and why.  

Basic text is sufficient, but you can also format the text with an array of _Markdown_ commands.  

And then you can run code within the same document, such as this R code for loading a small test dataset and show what it looks like.  

New line.

#### Load the file
```{r}
d <- read.csv('../../Data/testdat.csv', as.is=TRUE)
```

#### Show data format
First show the class of the object the data were stored in.
```{r}
message(class(d))
d
```

#### Done for now
That's enough to get started.
